# Work Log
## week starting march 20th

- accepted the assignment on Github classroom to begin the project setup.
- added swagger into the application.properties file and also added it into the pom.xml file. however im having an issue with the connection to the swagger API, hoping this will be fixed in the future.

## planning to do this week
- this week im planning on getting question 1 under way and hoping to get it done the end of this week.

## week starting march 27th
- This week I have got most question one completed, however I don't have the other programming language section of part one set up yet but I think I know how to go about it so im more clear about it.
- I also got Swagger to work, the issue I had with it is that it was just a versioning issue but managed to fix it.
- I Got the documentation done for the customer GET, POST, PUT and DELETE methods, within Swagger.

## plan on doing this week
- Got more clear answers about how question 2 is going to be implemented but time isn't on my side so I might have to leave it and move on to question 3 to try and get as much marks as possible.

### notes to self
- zebra crossing for the QR code.
- only 1 complex query may be needed depending on how it is implemented.
- might need more of the  less complex queries for the same amount of marks.
